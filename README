This is the README file for the radar scan program. The purpose of this
program is to, given a fixed guard position and a set of line segments,
return the line segments visible from the guard.

Entry:
    The algorithm expects the guard's coordinates as the first entry.

    It follows an arbitrary number of line segments, denoted by the two
coordinates of it's ends. Each coordinate is given by 2 floating point
numbers. To end input, hit control+D (sending EOF to standard input)

Example:
5 5

0 0 0 10
0 0 10 0
0 10 10 10
10 0 10 10

There is still much to be done. We shall remove the simplifying hipothesis
and add a graphical interface to the program.
