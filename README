This is the README file for the radar scan program. The purpose of this
program is to solve the following problem:

Given a point representing a fixed guard position and a set of line segments (similar to walls), return the list of line segments visible from the guard position. It is known that line segments are disjoint one another and the given point does not belong to any line segment.

Entry:
    The algorithm expects the guard's coordinates as the first entry.

    It follows an arbitrary number of line segments, denoted by the two
distinct coordinates of its end points. Each coordinate is represented by two floating point numbers. In order to finish the input, simply hit control+D (sending EOF to standard input).

Example:
5 5

0 0 0 10
0 0 10 0
0 10 10 10
10 0 10 10

There is still much to be done. We shall remove the simplifying hypothesis and add a graphical interface to the program.
